# Meiji data

The spread sheet is from pdfs, available on the Meiji Yasuda website from 2006-2022.

The data under meiji_yasuda_data is obtained by querying the API at the meiji yasuda website, using `get_meiji.py`.

The website does not show the survey size for any years except the current year, we either take it from the pdfs or from the data set Ogihara (2020)

There is a more recent page: Baby names in Japan, 2019-2024
