  <h2>Morae</h2>

  <p>If a character is a yo'on ("ゃ", "ゅ", "ょ", "ぁ", "ぃ", "ぇ", "ゎ") then attach to the previous character.
    <ul>
      <li>き + ゃ → きゃ
	</ul>
   


  <p>Code is in <code>utils.py</code>
  
  <h2>Syllables</h2>

  <ul>
    <li> Any mora followed by "ん" or  "っ" joins to that.
    <ul>
      <li>こ + ん → こん
      <li>き + っ → きっ
    </ul>
  <li> A mora ending in /a/ ('あ',  'か', 'が', 'きゃ', 'ぎゃ', ...)
    followed by a mora "あ", "い", "う" or "ー"
    <ul>
      <li>か + い → かい
      <li>あ + いん → あ + いん (ん joins first)
    </ul>
  <li> A mora ending in /i/ 
    followed by a mora "い" or "ー"
    <ul>
      <li>き + い → きい
    </ul>
  <li> A mora ending in /u/
    followed by a mora 'う'
    <ul>
      <li>く + う → くう
    </ul>
  <li> A mora ending in /e/ 
    followed by a mora  "い", "え" or "ー"
    <ul>
      <li>て + い →てい
      <li>て + え → てえ
    </ul>
  <li> A mora ending in /o/  followed by a mora "お", "う" or "ー"
    <ul>
      <li>と + う → とう
      <li>お + お → おお
    </ul>
</ul>
    
<p>It is not possible to determine syllable boundaries just from a
kana string.  We will always join when we can, starting from the
front.  Something like "みい" could be "み" + "い" or "みい", we will always produce "みい". Something like "とおう" could be "と" + "おう" or "とお" + "う", will produce the latter.

<p>Normally Japanese syllables only have two mora, but we have names like 'ろおい', which is probably intended to be pronounced like <i>Roy</i> which would be one syllable.  We currently treat this as two: 'ろお' + 'い'

    <h2>Counting first and last features</h2>

    <p>If we look for a feature in the first or last position, then we only do this if there are two or more. (char1, char_1, mora1, mora_1, syl1, syll_1)

    <p>If the feature is the last two, then we only do this if there are three or more.
 (char_2, mora_2, syll_2)
