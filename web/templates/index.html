  <h1>Overview &mdash; {{db_name}} ({{db_range[0]}}&ndash;{{db_range[1]}})</h1>

  <p>㊔ Welcome to <i>Japanese Given Names: Data, Analysis, and
  Interactive Resources</i>, a collection of curated data and an
  interactive tool for exploring trends in Japanese given names (名前 <i>namae</i>).

  <p>This site brings together data from three sources covering
  over a century of Japanese naming practices, and provides tools
  for searching, comparing and analyzing names by orthography,
  pronunciation, gender, and year.

  <h3>Data Sources</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt><a href='https://baby-calendar.jp/'>Baby Calendar</a> (2008&ndash;2022)</dt>
    <dd>Individual baby names with both orthography (kanji/kana)
      and pronunciation (hiragana), along with location and
      gender.  The original Baby Calendar site has much more
      information, including pictures &mdash; this is a small
      subset extracted for research purposes.</dd>

    <dt><a href='https://www.namaejiten.com/'>Heisei Namae Jiten</a>
      (1989&ndash;2009)</dt>
    <dd>Ranked name frequencies covering the Heisei era, with
      comprehensive frequency distributions (not just the top
      names).  Written forms only.</dd>

    <dt><a href='https://www.meijiyasuda.co.jp/enjoy/ranking/'>Meiji
	Yasuda Life Insurance Rankings</a> (1912&ndash;2024)</dt>
    <dd>The longest available series: top 10 written forms from
      1912, expanding to top 100 written forms with their frequencies and top 50
      pronunciations with frequencies from 2004. We show two views into this data:
      Meiji (orth) which shows the written (orthographic) forms from 2024 and
      Meiji (phon) which shows the pronunciations (phonological).</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>What You Can Do</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Search</b> for any name by orthography (書き方) or
      pronunciation (読み方), or look up individual kanji (漢字).</li>
    <li><b>Browse</b> name lists and frequency statistics.</li>
    <li><b>Analyze features</b> such as first/last characters,
      morae, syllables, script type, and name length.</li>
    <li><b>Explore phenomena</b> including name diversity over
      time, genderedness, androgyny, reduplication, irregular
      readings, and overlap between data sources.</li>
    <li><b>View trends by year</b>, with birth-rate
      normalization.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Use the <b>Settings</b> page to switch between data sources
  and colour palettes.
